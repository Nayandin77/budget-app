Visualization of Client <-> Backend

- = needs to be done
x = done

- Auth.js
    - User creates account (add more)
        X AUTH state gets created       
        X Mongo records User            
    - User logs in (add more + change naming)
        X AUTH state gets created       
        - MONTH state gets created
            X API retrieves info User from Mongo 
            X API retrieves info Months from Mongo 
    - User logs out (change naming)
        X AUTH state is cleared         
        X MONTH state is cleared        

Home.js (change naming, add more)
    - Share User with all components (maybe with state I can fix auth from going null on refresh)
    - Display Sign In text if AUTH || locolstorage.profile is empty           
    X Display components                                                     

Calender.js (change naming, add more)
    X Display Calender
    X Select Date (Month Year)  
        - If Month exist in state {MONTH}, retrieve data and display to other components (Amount, Details, Section)
        - If Month does not exist in state {MONTH}, create new Month and add to state { Month }


- Logic (Action -> Reducers + {API}) 
1. When User logs in, loads their Months data 
2. Force a User to click "Select Date" in order to load user data
3. 'Select Date' will:
    a. Look through state.calender.months to find {month}
    b. If no {month} found, create a {month}
4. Load selected { month } data to components Amount, Details, Calender(auto), Section
