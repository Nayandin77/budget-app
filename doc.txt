Visualization of Client <-> Backend

- Auth.js
    - User creates account
        X AUTH state gets created       
        X Mongo records User            
    - User logs in
        X AUTH state gets created       
    - MONTH state gets created
        X API retrieves info User from Mongo 
        X API retrieves info Months from Mongo 
    - User logs out
        X AUTH state is cleared         
        X MONTH state is cleared        

Home.js
    - Share User with all components (maybe with state I can fix auth from going null on refresh)
    - Display Sign In text if AUTH || locolstorage.profile is empty           
    X Display components                                                     

Calender.js
    X Display Calender
    X Select Date (Month Year)  
        - If Month exist in state {MONTH}, retrieve data and display to other components (Amount, Details, Section)
        - If Month does not exist in state {MONTH}, create new Month and add to state { Month }
