Home.js
    - Share User with all components (maybe with state I can fix auth from going null on refresh)
    - Display Sign In text if AUTH || locolstorage.profile is empty           
    X Display components                                                     

Calender.js
    X Display Calender
    X Select Date (Month Year)
        - If Month exist in state {MONTH}, retrieve data and display to other components (Amount, Details, Section)
        - If Month does not exist in state {MONTH}, create new Month and add to state { Month }
